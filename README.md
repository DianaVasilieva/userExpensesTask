# User`s Expenses Application

The program will help you to keep track of your`s and not only  expenses. 

For instance, you can:
- add another users;
- add expenses based on the category or date;
- get statistic of expenses for some particular period of time with a  percentage relation to the whole sum -> day, month, year;
- get statistic of expenses based on category or all together;
- delete all data in each table or in some particular row.

The app includes 5 files:
- Main Functional: 
database.py (table creation, values insert, finding expenses and other functions)
app.py (output to console)
- Unit Tests:
unit_tests.py (unit tests to main functions)
- Output of tables -> Users and Expenses 
expenses.txt
users.txt
Interpreter - Python 3.8.


How to start the program?
The app was built in Pycharm, so open the project there. If you need, install the libraries as ‘sqlite3’ / ‘datetime’. 
Start the program from the ‘app.py’ file. You will see the menu with functions choices in the console. So, choose any of them and then follow the instructions depicted on the console.
Notice! Each user and expenses added by you is in .txt - files, so if you want to choose some other user or whatsoever other thing, it is easier to choose.

To check unit tests just switch to ‘unit_tests.py’ and run it.
